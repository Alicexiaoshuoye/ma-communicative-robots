# Overview
This repository contains the code base of the Transformers project for the Communicative Robots Course at the Vrije Universiteit (VU).
In this repository, 4 sub researches are performed to investigate the performance of a T5 base model.

| Influence of triple length on generated sentences (automated evaluation)       | This subresearch investigates whether the triple length has an influence on the quality of the generated sentences. It does so by performing 3 automated evaluation metrics (BERTScore, BLEURT, sacreBLEU), and compares the outcome of these metrics between triple length groups.                                                                                                            | Caya    |
| Influence of triple length on generated sentences (human evaluation)           | This subresearch also investigates whether the triple length has an influence on the quality of the generated sentences. Instead of automated evaluation metrics, human evaluation is used to compare the generated sentences.  |  Mincke |
| Impact of different evaluation metrics on performance outcomes                 | This research investigates the outcome of different evaluation metrics.              | Pauline |
| Difference and similarities of human and automated evaluation                  | This research compares the outcome of human and automated evaluation methods.       | Rishvik |


# Evaluation 
Evaluation of the T5 model is performed in two different ways; a human evaluation based on response criteria, and using different automated evaluation metrics, such as BERTScore and BLEURT.
