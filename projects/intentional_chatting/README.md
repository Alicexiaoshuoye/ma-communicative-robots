# Project: Intentional chatting

## Overview

This repository contains the code base of the *Intentional chatting* project for the *Communicative Robots* Course at the Vrije Universiteit (VU), Amsterdam.

In this repository, we represent dialogue as knowledge graphs and use these representations to create artificial conversational agents that display specific intentions in their behaviour. For a detailed description of this project, please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAyJhZL9LMWbPoVhh-0CUIGN1dSUXEOJFJI2RPdDU68/edit#). In brief, the methods proposed include:
