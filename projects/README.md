# Projects

## Project 1: Triple extraction for a conversational AI

We extract a wide variety of noisy triples that the model outputs need to be normalized to a more abstract level.

Check out `./conversational_triple_extraction/`

## Project 2: Contextual Factors in Natural Language Generation

We identify contextual factors that should be considered during dialogues, especially when giving a summary of a dialogue.

Check out `./context_in_nlg/`

## Project 3: 

We represent dialogue as knowledge graphs and use these representations to create artificial conversational agents that display specific intentions in their behaviour.

Check out `./intentional_chatting/`
