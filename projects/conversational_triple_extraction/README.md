# Project: Triple extraction for a conversational AI

## Overview

This repository contains the code base of the *Triple extraction for a conversational AI* project for the *Communicative Robots* Course at the Vrije Universiteit (VU), Amsterdam.

In this repository, we extract a wide variety of noisy triples that the model outputs need to be normalized to a more abstract level. For a detailed description of this project, please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4EBIvYNy7DWStKosycVhVL6aEH5hKAvYSXtzpHB3Ck/edit#). In brief, the methods proposed include:
